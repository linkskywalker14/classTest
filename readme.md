## What Class r u?

A "personality test" to determine the D&D class best suited to the test taker. Written in a style reminiscent of similar tests that were popluar Internet forum pasttimes during my teenage years in the early 2000s. 

### Method

Each question corresponds with a single class (Fighter, Ranger, Thief, Cleric, or Magic User). When the test taker submits their answers, the answers are tallied, and whichever class's answer was selected most often is returned. 

If answers corresponding to two classes are selected in equal measure, a multiclass result is returned. 

If answers corresponding to three or more classes are selected in equal measure, the test taker is considered to be an irresolute jack of all trades and master of none, thereby relegating themselves to the humiliation of playing a Bard.

### Challenges

The purpose of this project is to put what I've learned recently into practice. 

- This is the first time I've used Loops or Arrays in Javascript.
- I wanted a better divide between Interface & Business logic than in my last project.
- I struggled with how to identify which D&D Class had the highest number associated with it. I first solved this with a clunky If/Then tree, but later settled on making each class into an array with both a numeric value, and a string containing its name. 
- I struggled with how to identify when one of the questions had not been answered, so that an alert could pop up to insist that each question have at least one box checked. To be honest, I'm not entirely certain why this version of the code works when so many previous attempts failed. I probably lack a sufficient understanding of the difference between "Undefined" and "Null." (As an aside, I think the quiz is more fun if players are able to skip questions they don't like, but since this is coding practice rather than design practice, I opted for more coding challenges rather than fewer.)
