        <h5>You see your crush, what do you do!?:</h5>
        <input type="checkbox" name="playstyle" value="Fighter">Impress them with great feats of strength!<br />
        <input type="checkbox" name="playstyle" value="Ranger">Ask if they'd like to go on a nature walk together.<br />
        <input type="checkbox" name="playstyle" value="Thief">Charm them with my winning smile. I've never had any trouble stealing hearts.<br />
        <input type="checkbox" name="playstyle" value="Cleric">My parents say I'm not allowed to begin a courtship until I'm out of school.<br />
        <input type="checkbox" name="playstyle" value="Magician">Relationships are a distraction from what's really important. I have better things to do.<br /><br />
        <h5>Your teacher is assigning wayyy too much homework! What are you gonna do about that?:</h5>
        <input type="checkbox" name="playstyle" value="Fighter">Ignore it! I get by on my athletecism, not my intellect.<br />
        <input type="checkbox" name="playstyle" value="Ranger">Diligently track down all the answers.<br />
        <input type="checkbox" name="playstyle" value="Thief">I bought a teacher's edition of the textbook before class even started. I just make a "mistake" now and then to keep it looking real.<br />
        <input type="checkbox" name="playstyle" value="Cleric">They wouldn't have assigned so much if they didn't think we were up to the task. We have to trust our teacher's wisdom and do our best!<br />
        <input type="checkbox" name="playstyle" value="Magician">Just do it all. It's not like anything they assign is actually difficult.<br /><br />
        <h5>Your parents want you to play outside instead of playing your favorite new video game, what now?:</h5>
        <input type="checkbox" name="playstyle" value="Fighter">Lock my steely-eyed gaze with theirs, maybe flex a bit. If I wanna play vidja, then I'm gonna play vidja.<br />
        <input type="checkbox" name="playstyle" value="Ranger">Phew, thank goodness! I was only playing those video games to fit in. <br />
        <input type="checkbox" name="playstyle" value="Thief">Act like it's fine, then sneak back in and keep playing.<br />
        <input type="checkbox" name="playstyle" value="Cleric">I suppose I had been inside a lot today. My parents just want what's best for me after all.<br />
        <input type="checkbox" name="playstyle" value="Magician">I will sit outside, adamantly refusing to have fun, and thinking up all the myriad ways I will get revenge on my parents someday.<br /><br />
        <h5>You've been called into the principal's office to answer for your behavior. What did you do!?:</h5>
        <input type="checkbox" name="playstyle" value="Fighter">Beat up some jerk-ass kid who deserved every bruise I gave 'em.<br />
        <input type="checkbox" name="playstyle" value="Ranger">Wandered off school grounds during lunch period.<br />
        <input type="checkbox" name="playstyle" value="Thief">I didn't do anything. Nobody saw. You've got no proof.<br />
        <input type="checkbox" name="playstyle" value="Cleric">I didn't do anything, but I was close enough to some kids who did that I got sent along with them, and I'm absolutely terrified of what's going to happen.<br />
        <input type="checkbox" name="playstyle" value="Magician">Apparently finishing the assignment before the teacher finishes explaining it is "disrespectful." I can't roll my eyes hard enough.<br /><br />
        <h5>You want to go see a movie with your besties, what do you go see?:</h5>
        <input type="checkbox" name="playstyle" value="Fighter">An action movie! Guns! Swords! Explosions! Adrenaline!<br />
        <input type="checkbox" name="playstyle" value="Ranger">A nature documentary.<br />
        <input type="checkbox" name="playstyle" value="Thief">A detective mystery, or maybe a spy thriller. Those always give me ideas...<br />
        <input type="checkbox" name="playstyle" value="Cleric">A nice historical drama. I was definitely born in the wrong generation.<br />
        <input type="checkbox" name="playstyle" value="Magician">An arthouse film. If my parents could enjoy it, it's not weird enough to be worth watching.<br /><br />
        <h5>Your mom finds something you had hidden under your bed...uh-oh, what did she find?:</h5>
        <input type="checkbox" name="playstyle" value="Fighter">Porn, duh. Sometimes I gotta rub one out, don't make a big deal about it.<br />
        <input type="checkbox" name="playstyle" value="Ranger">Weed. Sometimes I just need some help relaxing, ya know?<br />
        <input type="checkbox" name="playstyle" value="Thief">There are many perfectly sensible reasons to own a set of lock picks. It's a respectable hobby!<br />
        <input type="checkbox" name="playstyle" value="Cleric">Secular philosophy--but only so I can better understand how to argue against it!<br />
        <input type="checkbox" name="playstyle" value="Magician">Lots of weird stuff she doesn't understand. She said she wished it was just porn.<br /><br />
        <h5>A guy you don't know that well asks if you want some of his drugs. What do you say?:</h5>
        <input type="checkbox" name="playstyle" value="Fighter">I suppose I've always been a little curious about steroids...<br />
        <input type="checkbox" name="playstyle" value="Ranger">No thanks, I forage my own magic mushrooms.<br />
        <input type="checkbox" name="playstyle" value="Thief">Act completely disinterested so he won't suspect me when someone steals his supply.<br />
        <input type="checkbox" name="playstyle" value="Cleric">My body is a temple, I'm gonna call the police!<br />
        <input type="checkbox" name="playstyle" value="Magician">LSD for me please!<br /><br />
        <h5>Eugh, your little brat of a brother won't stay out of your room. What are you going to do about it?:</h5>
        <input type="checkbox" name="playstyle" value="Fighter">Wrassle them into submission.<br />
        <input type="checkbox" name="playstyle" value="Ranger">Lay a snare to catch them in the act.<br />
        <input type="checkbox" name="playstyle" value="Thief">Maybe he'll be more conscientious if his favorite toys start to...disappear.<br />
        <input type="checkbox" name="playstyle" value="Cleric">Lecture them on the virtues of respecting private property.<br />
        <input type="checkbox" name="playstyle" value="Magician">I've got a whole book filled with curses that are perfectly suited to punishing the whelp.<br />
